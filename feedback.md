1. What was your favorite part of the class?

  My favorite part of the class was that we were able to use a new program to utilize and learn from. I liked how the lessons were planned and how the instructor was able to take it step by step on how to do the homework. 

2. What was your least favorite part of the class?

  It was on Zoom, I wish there was a different platform to use for the class to interact more on the online platform. With the Zoom recordings sometimes the audio was funky or the video quality was not as great. 

3. Do you have any suggestions for how the instructor could improve the class experience for future students?

    Being able to bring in speakers for us that are using a lot of tech skills in their career, or being able to offer how to find jobs in GIS and what places are best to find those. Thank you Professor Alex for everything, you have opened my eyes to Python, and thank you for checking in on us to understand how the students are doing as well! It means a lot when the professors have tine and genuinely ask how students are doing and how they can help.
