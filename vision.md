1. What is your "dream" GIS/tech job?

   My dream GIS tech job would be to work as a GIS Analyst or a Remote Sensing Analyst/Technician. The type of work or company I would like to work with would be anything related to Environmental or Marine Science. I want to get my part 107 UAV flying license to add more to my understanding of Remote Sensing. It would be great if I got to work under a Marine Science organization and map out the seafloor, whale migrations, historical changes in abalone, etc. My ultimate dream job is to become a Marine Biologist or to find a career in Marine Biology and utilize my GIS skills. Recently, in this field, there will be a requirement to know GIS and luckily I have the advance to find my dream job.

2. What GIS applications or technologies excite you most?

    The GIS applications I am excited to be able to keep learning new tools in remote sensing. I would love to find ways to enhance the Lidar models and being able to get more involved in using ROVs to map the seafloor. Anything that has to deal with remote sensing, I am all for it!

3. What GIS skills/techniques or non-GIS hobbies would you like to focus on after this semester ends?

  My non-GIS hobbies are doing photography, so hopefully I will get to do more traveling and take more photos! I want to invest into more lens and cameras for me to use, but since I am into wildlife photography the lens that I want are over $500, but I am working to save up money. At one point it would be nice to take a photography course and enhance my skills! I am also into working out so I would like to get involved in kickboxing or pilates! After I graduate my plan is to work for a couple of years and then go back to school and get my Masters or PhD in Marine Science.
